<h2>‚ö° About Me</h2>

Hello there, my name is Eric Dennis, and I am a dedicated student at Georgia Southern University pursuing a major in I.T. with a focus on Data Science. With a strong aspiration to become a data analyst, I am set to graduate in the Fall of 2024.

My passion for learning and all things technology has led me to achieve the President's list twice while maintaining an exceptional 4.0 GPA. I apply this same level of dedication and enthusiasm to my work. Moreover, I possess a unique skill for telling stories with data, which makes me an excellent candidate for the field of data analysis.
